# Matchly.io
A full scale javascript application that creates a dynamic intuitive user interface that integrates with the users current data system by providing a dynamic and intuitive data upload process that allows users to set and define both the uploaded data's visitors and schools. 


##Getting started

* Running tests, `npm  test`
* continually run tests `npm run-script test:watch`
* Start local server `npm run-script start-dev`
* Build assets for deploy `npm run-script build-assets`

##Further Steps
 Test coverage for actions and reducers is quite low and this needs to be improved before we transfer functionality over to troopa.
  * test for edge cases manually
  * E2E testing
